    <h3 id="what-is-pok">What is POK?</h3>
<p>POK is a partitioned operating system, which means it isolates drivers and
applications in time and space. No driver/application can use more than its
allocated resources.</p>

<p>The concept of partitioned architectures is introduced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_653">ARINC653</a> 
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Independent_Levels_of_Security">MILS</a> standards. 
POK is fully compatible with these standards.</p>

<h3 id="why-pok-isolates-applications">Why POK isolates applications?</h3>

<p>Drivers and applications isolation is done for safety and security reasons.
By isolating in space, we make sure that each partition cannot access
other address space.</p>

<p>Time isolation means that each partition has enough time to be
executed. We guarantee that a function has the timeslice it requires to be 
executed and no other application can preempt it.</p>

<p>By using a minimal micro-kernel and separating each component in each own
partition, we also facilitate the system analysis and certification.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-aadl">What is AADL?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.aadl.info">AADL</a> is a modeling language that describes system architectures. 
We use this language has a frontend to model and validate the architecture and generate the
configuration and runtime code.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ocarina">What is Ocarina?</h3>

<p>Ocarina is an AADL toolsuite that is used to process AADL models and generate
configuration code for POK.
You can get the source code of Ocarina on the <a href="https://github.com/OpenAADL/ocarina">Ocarina github page</a>.</p>

<p>No worries, you can use POK without Ocarina.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-pok-without-aadl-">Can I use POK without AADL ?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you lose code generation benetifs and need to write the configuration
and runtime code yourself.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-does-it-cost-">How much does it cost ?</h3>
<p>POK is a free-software (free as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”): the code is released under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD license</a>.
You can modify, adapt code and join our developer team.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-jetos">What is JetOS?</h3>
<p>POK has been forked and re-licensed under the GPLv3 by ISPRAS under the name <a href="http://www.ispras.ru/en/proceedings/isp_29_2017_3/isp_29_2017_3_171/">JetOS</a>. You can
find the source code of the fork <a href="https://github.com/yoogx/forge.ispras.ru-git-chpok">here</a>.
This fork is <a href="http://www.startlr.com/in-russia-it-is-planned-to-create-an-operating-system-for-aircraft/">actually used</a> for commercial airplanes in Russia:
<em>“There is already a working prototype of the RTOS, operating on the platforms of domestic developers. A certification package that meets the requirements of the Russian aviation authorities is planned to be received in accordance with the concluded contracts at the end of 2019”</em></p>

<h3 id="who-provides-support-for-pok">Who provides support for POK?</h3>

<p>There might be available support through different companies.
<a href="http://www.reblochon.io">Reblochon</a> provides commercial support for POK.</p>
